Investigation Title	Single cell RNA-Seq profiling of human embryonic kidney outer and inner cortical cells and kidney organoid cells				
Experiment Description	To study the developmental process of human podocytes and compare to the in vitro counterpart, we dissociated cells from the inner and outer kidney cortex as well as kidney organoids, and performed 10X Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing. Identifying cell types and studying human podocyte developmental process in human kidney and in organoids

Protocol Description	10X Genomics: Chromium Single Cell 3’ v2 single cell RNA-Seq of poly A selected mRNA;	Base call by bcl2fastq v. 2.17; adaptor and index sequences were trimmed Reads were mapped using STAR 2.5.1b and the NCBI GTF annotation accession NCBI:GCA_000001405.14 Count tables were generated from the FASTQ files using the Cell Ranger software version 1.3.1 with default parameters. Read 1 is the Cell Barcode + UMI and read 2 is the actual RNA sequence bam file contains cell barcode for each read at CR:Z tag Genome_build: GRCh37.p13	De-identified human fetal tissue was obtained from elective terminations with informed consent with the approval of Institutional Review Boards of both Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles and the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. Gestational age was determined using guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists using a combination of ultrasound and last menstrual measurements (O’Rahilly and Müller 2010, O’Rahilly et al., 1987, Strachan et al., 1997). Samples were delivered on ice at 4°C in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich) and 25mM HEPES (Gibco). H9 hESC line (female) was obtained from WiCell (WA09). The MAFB-P2A-eGFP hESC line was generated by knocking-in the P2A-eGFP cassette into the 3’ end of MAFB locus by employing CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The donor plasmid, gRNA and Cas9 protein were introduced into H9 cells via electroporation (Thermofisher, MPK5000S). For single-cell cloning, the targeted H9 cells were dissociated into single cells using Accutase (StemCell Technologies), and 200 cells were seeded in a Geltrex-coated 100-mm dish with 10ml of mTeSR (supplemented with 10μm Y27632). Single cell-derived colonies were picked up and expanded for Southern blot validations. Key sequences important for cell line generation are listed in Table S2 under “DNA Sequences (cell line)”. hESC Maintenance and Differentiation to Generate Kidney Organoids MAFB-P2A-eGFP H9 hESC cells were cultured in StemFit media (Ajinomoto, ASB01-R) supplemented with 10ng/ml of FGF2 (R&D, 273-F9) on Geltrex-coated plates (Geltrex from ThermoFisher, A1413302). When cells reach 60% confluent, differentiation was started following the Bonventre protocol with minor modification: 4 days of 8μM CHIR99021 (Sigma Aldrich, SML1046) treatment, followed by 3 days of 10ng/ml ActivinA (R&D, 338-AC-050) incubation, and 1 day of 10ng/ml FGF9 incubation. On day8, the cells were dissociated using TrypLE dissociation enzyme (Gibco, 12563011), and cell number was acquired. 75,000 cells/well were seeded on a 96-well ultralow-attachment plate (Corning, CLS7007) to form aggregates. The aggregates were formed in 3uM CHIR and 10ng/ml FGF9. On Day10, the media was changed to basal media with 10ng/ml FGF9. From Day13 to Day28, the aggregates were cultured in growth factor-free basal media. All differentiation steps were done using basal differentiation media (Advanced RPMI 1640 (Gibco, 12633020) + 1X Glutamax (Gibco, 35050079) + 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Invitrogen, 15070063).
